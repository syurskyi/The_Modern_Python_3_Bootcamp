# Using .format()

first = "Venus"
last = "Williams"
formatted = "First Name: {}, Last Name: {}".format(first, last)

# Though Udemy's platform doesn't support f-string yet, I think it's a much nicer syntax:

first = "Venus"
last = "Williams"
formatted = f"First Name: {first}, Last Name: {last}"
print(formatted)
